## What is it?

In the month of January 2021, DigitalOcean parterned with Dev.to and commenced **Dockathon**. It was just like another hackathon event except one thing. You will have to built something on DigitalOcean newly launched App platform. I saw this as a great opportunity to learn about the platform meanthile I participate. So I have decided to create a web app. For a long time, I wanted to try out the **Google's Books API** and that is why I decided to build **Bookplorer**, a dedicated book finder. Afterwards it was more about choosing tools to built it and I decided to go with something entirely new üòÅ. More info in **How I built it** section.

## Category Submission:

I would say this falls into the "Program for the people" category. The reason is pretty much clear, It will help users to find books.

## App Link

Since the app itself has been deployed to DigitalOcean, live demo can be found over [here](https://bookplorer-mn5g9.ondigitalocean.app/)

## Description

Bookplorer is all about finding your favorite books, share them with your friends on social media or you can buy them. It is backed by Google Books API. You can explore books with the help of volume or Author name. Decorated with **neumorphic** style, this app comes with a lean and clean UI.

## Permissive License

Bookplorer is licensed under the MIT license.

## Background

Of course, you can google anything and everything. But sometimes results become cluttered with other non-wanted articles and materials. Bookplorer has one goal, that your search results should reflect books by removing other distracting stuff.

In this pandemic, I felt that people should have utilized most of their time by reading books. Books, they thought that they will read someday. This utility will help you search those books, share them with your friends, or buy them.

## How I built it

Bookplorer is built using **Svelte** ecosystem. Yeah right!! I ditched Vue and React. Why? Because I really wanted to learn this awesome framework by building something. Well, what's better than a hackathon. The icing on the cake was DigitalOcean's app platform that made the deployment process "A Child's play". Most importantly the **Autodeploy code changes** feature.

## Additional Resources/Info

It was not possible to build the app without [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using#st_params) and [Svelte tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics)
